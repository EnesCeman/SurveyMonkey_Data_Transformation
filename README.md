Through this tutorial I had a chance to practice following skills: 
* importing excel into pandas and exporting it afterwards into excel again
* manipulating/cleaning data (renaming, dropping columns)
* unpivoting data (pandas **melt** function)
* joining data from multiple sources (pandas **merge** function)
* aggregating/summarizing data
